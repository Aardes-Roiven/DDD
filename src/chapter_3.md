# Google Calendar API Integration
Overview
The Google Calendar API allows you to programmatically interact with users’ calendars, create events, and manage schedules. Whether you’re building a scheduling application or enhancing an existing one, integrating with Google Calendar can streamline event management.

Getting Started
Authentication: Obtain API credentials (OAuth 2.0) to authenticate your application with Google Calendar.
Endpoints: Familiarize yourself with the available endpoints for creating, updating, and retrieving calendar events.
Scopes: Understand the required scopes for accessing calendar data.

Example Code

```Python

# Python example using the Google Calendar API
import googleapiclient.discovery
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials

# Initialize credentials (replace with your own)
credentials = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file("credentials.json")
service = googleapiclient.discovery.build("calendar", "v3", credentials=credentials)

# Create an event
event = {
    "summary": "Team Meeting",
    "start": {"dateTime": "2024-04-15T10:00:00", "timeZone": "America/New_York"},
    "end": {"dateTime": "2024-04-15T11:00:00", "timeZone": "America/New_York"},
}
service.events().insert(calendarId="primary", body=event).execute()
```
